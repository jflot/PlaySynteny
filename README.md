# PlaySynteny: a genome evolution practical

Connect via ssh to the hydra cluster of ULB (hydra.ulb.ac.be)

Create a folder for this practical; cd into it.

Download the genome and proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sce) from https://www.yeastgenome.org/ and Candida glabrata (Cgl) from http://www.candidagenome.org.

Install miniasm and minimap2 and add them to your $PATH.

Compare the two genomes using minimap2 and draw a synteny plot using minidot (included into the miniasm package).

Install the the package MCScanX and add it to your $PATH.

Perform a MCScanX synteny analysis comparing the two genomes, and an analysis of the different types of gene duplicates found in each genome.
